            <h2 class="section-title">Why INCREASE4MED?</h2>
            <p class="section-description">The Mediterranean basin is home to over 510 million people and is warming significantly faster than the global average. In recent years, droughts, floods and water scarcity have intensified, threatening ecosystems, agriculture and communities. Traditional approaches to water and land management struggle to address the region’s unique ecological and socio‑economic diversity. INCREASE4MED was conceived to bridge this gap by deploying science‑based, scalable nature‑based solutions that work hand‑in‑hand with local stakeholders.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Our Vision</h2>
            <p class="section-description">INCREASE4MED integrates ecological restoration with socio‑economic resilience. We combine cutting‑edge research, field‑tested interventions and multi‑actor governance to build an adaptable framework for water and land sustainability. By aligning with key EU strategies such as the European Green Deal, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and the Water Resilience Strategy, our project supports climate adaptation, biodiversity restoration and sustainable agriculture throughout the Mediterranean.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Methodology</h2>
            <p class="section-description">INCREASE4MED applies a rigorous, comparative methodology across its pilot regions. Each site collects baseline ecological and socio‑economic data, applies tailored NbS portfolios and evaluates their effects against business‑as‑usual scenarios using models such as SWAT. Results inform our multi‑criteria impact assessment and feed directly into the digital decision‑support tool. Through continuous monitoring, adaptive management and stakeholder feedback, we ensure that insights are transferable and scalable.</p>
